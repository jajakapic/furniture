<p>Contemporary home design is much more complex than the modern style homes. Of course, what was happening “now” back in 1950 is not what’s happening now in the 21st century. Although contemporary and modern terms have overlapping characteristics these days, the two style genres have different histories and different methods.

Although contemporary and modern terms have overlapping characteristics these days, the two style genres have different histories and different methods. Indeed, we have seen more change in art over the past 200 years than in any other time span in history. Ever heard of the term, “that’s so yesterday’s news.”</p>

Even though each style incorporates neutral colors, modern design favors a warmer and more subdued color palette, whereas contemporary design favors starker and more striking hues. Yes, modern elements feature in contemporary designs, but innovation and a sense of fun set it apart from its predecessors. Here are the most common similarities shared between contemporary vs modern design.</p>
