Don’t forget to include the fireplace and make sure the room can comfortably accommodate a big crowd for tv viewing. Large crème colored tiles cover the entire space whereas the kitchen cabinets are a soft chestnut shade. Classy jute chairs and conventional sofas can be seen but the pristine steel handles on the cabinets, steel vent hood, and utensils coupled with steel spotlights in the kitchen say hello to the modern style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
