&lt;p&gt;Designed with a decorative modern silhouette, the vase is pretty enough to show off without any fillings. For an even more striking display, fill it up with dry branches, silk flowers, or tall, wispy grass. An eclectic space can always employ a colorful floor vase, while a traditional home can opt for a more rustic look. There are some decorators that use artificial decorative stick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
