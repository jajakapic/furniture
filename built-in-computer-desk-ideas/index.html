The work desk comes in the form of an alcove with drawers and lights. Diy built in desks can either come with cabinetry and shelving, or it can be as simple as a single piece of floating desktop fixed to a wall. Let it go unfinished if you prefer something rustic. Go for a wide variety of home office storage ideas, such as shelves for books, magazine files and ornaments, drawers with file hangers for paperwork, drawers for pens, and cabinets to hide away bulky items or printers.
