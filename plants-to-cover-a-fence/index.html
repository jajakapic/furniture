Most hedges and bushes are low maintenance, requiring little to work to keep them looking beautiful. Simply fix wires or trellis to the fence, which climbing plants can use for support, and which you can tie stems into as they grow. Next to it is an artichoke plant, which not only produces delicious artichokes—it is also often grown as an ornamental plant. If you really want to get away with a vine for the speed, but can�t plant over your neighbor�s fence, put up a simple fence or trellis of your own (maybe just wire between poles) and grow something over it fast.
