<p>In a traditional italian kitchen, wooden ceiling beams are exposed, with a stone tile on both the floor and walls, which is ideal in a european country to keep the room cool while cooking and preparing food. This tuscan italian style kitchen was designed by maraya with an arch over the stove area, and a plaster hood to give it an old world charm. Appliances and accessories run the gamut in italian kitchen design, from simple stainless steel designs that can work with anything from a tuscan design to mediterranean style italian kitchen, to vintage or more modern styles in bright and bold colors. This large kitchen is a good example of such, as it combines a variety of natural finishes, as well as rustic finishing techniques to achieve this look.</p>
