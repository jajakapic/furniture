Navy Beadboard with gold spray painted fixtures From pinterest.com
Beadboard vinyl wallpaper looks real and i’ll even say that i like it better than regular beadboard panels because the wallpaper won’t have the large seams in between each panel. I love the idea of painting beadboard to bring some color into your bathroom, like this one. The same goes for picking the right finish, sheen, and base coat. White beadboard is very pretty, but we wanted some color this time.
