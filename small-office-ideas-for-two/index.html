2 Person Desk Simple Solving Problem for Small Office or From homesfeed.com
An excellent office need not be large. You don’t necessarily need a desk designed for two to be able to share your home office with someone else. A simple white desk doesn�t overwhelm a small space, and a floating shelf provides extra storage when floor space is scarce. Filing cabinets are a great office storage solution and come in a variety of sizes, meaning you can grab yourself a small one that will fit neatly away in an office corner.
