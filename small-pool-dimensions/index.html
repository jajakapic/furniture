We consider small pools to be up to 26� long and up to 12� or 13� wide. It’s considered that at least 46 feet (14 meters) in length is proper for lap swimming. A small backyard doesn’t have to be a barrier to owning a pool of your own. The average price of a small inground pool (10×20) can range from $10,000 and up depending on soil conditions, depth and water features.
