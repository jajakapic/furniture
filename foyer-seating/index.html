Dorel Wildwood Rustic Gray Entryway Bench From kmart.com
The hall is the first image that reflects your house. Eclectic foyer features a centered round black pedestal foyer table seating two hair bin stools and a white stool positioned on a black and white zebra rug lit by a sputnik hung from a stained oak ceiling in front of a glass paneled white french door surrounded by stained oak trim frame by white walls. Designing seating for a small foyer with stairs isn’t as easy as it sounds. First of all, there is an obvious space problem.
